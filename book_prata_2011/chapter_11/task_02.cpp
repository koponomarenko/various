/*
	Modify the Vector class header and implementation files (Listings 11.13 and 11.14)
	so that the magnitude and angle are no longer stored as data components.
	Instead, they should be calculated on demand when the magval() and angval() methods
	are called. You should leave the public interface unchanged (the same public meth-
	ods with the same arguments) but alter the private section, including some of the
	private method and the method implementations.
	
	Test the modified version with Listing 11.15,
	which should be left unchanged because the public interface of the
	Vector class is unchanged.
